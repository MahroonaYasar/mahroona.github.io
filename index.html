    <h1>My Senior Project: Ticketing System</h1>
    <p>
      The <strong> Perot Museum of Nature and Science </strong> is a large
      science museum that services the <em> Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex</em>.
      The museum<br />
      consists of an IT team that conducts services and maintenance to the
      facility. The team does repairs, creates new exhibits, software fixes,<br />
      coding fixes, hardware swaps, PC rebuilds, and PC reimages. As the team is
      also considered the exhibit team, some other tasks include painting,<br />
      re-gluing items, and repairing items. Our client is an individual apart of
      the IT team that is looking to come up with a redesigned and simpler<br />
      ticketing system that will allow users to manage tickets of varying tasks
      quickly and easily. Additionally, to improve the level of productivity
      and<br />
      efficiency, implementing a priority system with quick-search abilitie will
      be beneficial.
